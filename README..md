# Exploring godot

My first serious dive into godot game engine

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luf2Kr5s3BM) video was followed to make this game a reality hence all credits goes to the content creator.

I also like to thank *Sprout Lands* for the wonderful free assets they provide which I use for this project.

All credit goes to these indivisuals and the godot opensource community for this wonderful software.
